1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Missing Value Handling: We checked for missing values in the dataset and handled them, particularly in columns like key and in_shazam_charts.
Data Transformation: Converted certain columns (like key) into meaningful categories, or applied appropriate fill methods for missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploring the Dataset: We explored key columns like track_name, artist(s)_name, streams, danceability_%, energy_%, and valence_%.
Data Visualization: Used visualizations like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to analyze the distribution of key features and their relationship with streams.
3. Analysis of Key Insights:
Top Streamed Artists and Songs: We identified the most streamed artists and songs by aggregating the streams column and visualizing the results.
Feature Impact on Streams: We analyzed the correlation between streams and features like danceability, energy, and valence using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to understand how these features affect streaming success.
Time-Based Trends: We explored how streams changed over time, by looking at streams by year, month, and day, to identify any seasonal or temporal trends.
4. Project Presentation:
Notebook Setup: The project is published on Kaggle with a clear heading and markdown that outlines the analysis steps and visualizations.
Attractive Notebook Title: You chose the title "Spotify Analytics: Features & Streaming Impact" to make the project appealing and relevant to data analysis.
Future Steps (Optional):
You could further expand the analysis by including more advanced statistical tests or machine learning models, if you'd like to add more depth.
Also, you might consider integrating other datasets to create a more comprehensive analysis (e.g., adding metadata or user behavior data).
